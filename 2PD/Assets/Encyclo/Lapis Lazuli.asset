  Description: "Lapis lazuli, often referred to as just 'lapis', has been used as
    a gemstone for thousands of years. It has been mined from Afghanistan since the
    early 7th millennium BC, and it was discovered in ancient burial sites throughout
    the Caucasus, the Mehrgarh and even as far as the Republic of Mauritania.\r\n\r\nThe
    funeral mask for the ancient Egyptian pharaoh 'King Tutankhamun' was even discovered
    to have been decorated with lapis lazuli."
