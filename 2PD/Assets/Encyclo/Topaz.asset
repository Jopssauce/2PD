  Description: "The gemstone representing Saggitarius.\r\n\r\nTopaz in its natural
    state is a golden brown to yellow, a characteristic which means it is sometimes
    confused with the less valuable gemstone citrine.\r\n\r\nTopaz is commonly associated
    with silicic igneous rocks of the granite and rhyolite type."
