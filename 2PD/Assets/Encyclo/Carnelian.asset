  Description: "The gemstone representing Leo.\r\n\r\nOnyx is black and white banded
    agate. Onyx takes its name from the Greek word \"onux\", which means fingernail;
    this could be due to a Greek legend, in which Eros mischievously cut the fingernails
    of Aphrodite with an arrowhead whilst she slept, and the gods turned the clippings
    into stone."
  Location: "1st Floor main dungeon, 1st Dungeon\r\n2nd Dungeon\r\n3rd Dungeon"
