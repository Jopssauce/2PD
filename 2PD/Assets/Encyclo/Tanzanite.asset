  Description: "Tanzanite is a blue to violet gemstone which is a member of the zoisite
    mineral group.\r\n\r\nTanzanite is pleochroic, which means that it shows different
    colors depending on the viewing angle. In order to get the preferred blue or violet-blue
    hue, gem artisans must properly orient tanzanite gemstones."
